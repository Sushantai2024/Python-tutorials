    "### 1. Opening a File (open())\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any operations on a file, it needs to be opened using the open() function. This function returns a file object, which can be used to read or write data.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Syntax :\n",
    "file_object = open(file_name, mode)\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tfile_name: The name of the file (with extension) you want to open.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tmode: The mode in which the file is opened (e.g., read, write). Some common modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t'r': Read mode (default). Opens the file for reading. Raises an error if the file does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t'w': Write mode. Opens the file for writing, truncating the file first if it exists or creating a new one if it doesn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t'a': Append mode. Opens the file for appending; any data written is added to the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t'r+': Read and write mode. Opens the file for both reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\t'b': Binary mode. Used for binary files (e.g., images, videos) by appending 'b' to the modes above (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').\n",
